# 🧠 Obsidian Graph RAG: Complete System Overview

**Transform your Obsidian vault into an intelligent, interactive knowledge exploration system.**

## 🌟 What Is This?

This is a **Graph RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)** system specifically designed for Obsidian vaults. It combines:

- 🕸️ **Knowledge Graphs** - Maps the connections between your notes
- 🔍 **Vector Search** - Finds semantically similar content  
- 🤖 **AI Chat** - Answers questions about your knowledge
- 🌐 **3D Visualization** - Interactive exploration of your note connections

**In Simple Terms:** It reads all your Obsidian notes, understands how they connect, and gives you powerful ways to explore and query your knowledge - either by chatting with an AI that knows your notes, or by exploring a 3D interactive map of your ideas.

## 🧠 How It Works (The Big Picture)

### The Graph RAG Concept
Traditional RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) only uses vector similarity to find relevant documents. **Graph RAG** is smarter - it combines:

1. **Semantic Search**: "Find notes similar to this topic"
2. **Graph Traversal**: "Also include notes connected to those notes"
3. **AI Generation**: "Answer the question using this richer context"

### Your Obsidian Vault → Knowledge Graph

```
Your Notes:          Knowledge Graph:           AI Understanding:
┌─────────────┐     ┌─────────────────────┐    ┌─────────────────┐
│ Note A      │────▶│     A ←→ B ←→ C     │───▶│ "I can answer   │
│ [[Note B]]  │     │     ↕    ↕    ↕     │    │  questions      │
└─────────────┘     │     D ←→ E ←→ F     │    │  about your     │
┌─────────────┐     │     ↕    ↕    ↕     │    │  knowledge!"    │
│ Note B      │────▶│     G ←→ H ←→ I     │    └─────────────────┘
│ [[Note C]]  │     └─────────────────────┘
└─────────────┘
```

### 📋 Phase-by-Phase Breakdown

1. **📁 Document Scanning**
   - Scans your Obsidian vault for `.md` files
   - Respects `.obsidian` folder exclusions
   - Tracks file changes for incremental updates

2. **📝 Document Processing** 
   - Parses markdown content
   - Extracts frontmatter, titles, tags
   - Identifies document metadata

3. **🔗 Link Extraction**
   - Finds `[[wikilinks]]` between notes
   - Maps `![[embeds]]` and `#tags`
   - Builds relationship network

4. **🕸️ Knowledge Graph Construction**
   - Creates network graph (nodes = documents, edges = links)
   - Calculates connection weights
   - Identifies communities/clusters

5. **🔍 Vector Embedding Generation**
   - Generates OpenAI embeddings for semantic search
   - Caches embeddings for performance
   - Enables "similarity" queries

6. **🧠 Graph RAG Retrieval**
   - Combines vector search + graph traversal
   - Finds relevant documents via multiple pathways
   - Provides rich context for AI responses

7. **🎮 User Interfaces**
   - Interactive 3D visualization
   - Conversational AI chat
   - Web browser interface
